## Description
Blue Red Square is the first game I made. Developed on Scratch, it is a rhythm game where the goal is to move a black square from one side of the screen to the other using the arrow keys, on a path of blue tiles that, every second, can turn red based on a pattern. If the player steps on a red tile or goes off the path, they are teleported back to the start.

I then exported the game with [Turbowarp](https://packager.turbowarp.org/?import_from=https://turbowarp.org) to an HTML file to publish it on Itch.io.  
This game allowed me to work on level management, loading, and saving. The main issues with the game are that level selection is not intuitive and not permissive (for example, player-created levels are not available unless the previous levels have been completed). The user interface is also not very intuitive.
