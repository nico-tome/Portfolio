### Description
  Blue Red Square is the first game I made. Created on Scratch, it is a rhythm game whose goal is to move a black square from one side of the screen to the other, using the keyboard arrows, on a path of blue squares that can turn red every second depending on a pattern. If the player steps on a red square or goes off the path, he is teleported to the beginning.

I then exported the game with [Turbowarp](https://packager.turbowarp.org/?import_from=https://turbowarp.org) to an executable to publish it on Itch.io .

### Includes

- Sound settings and color blind option.
- Level editors

### Description
  Fisc Adventure is a satirical game made for a course project. Made on scratch and using the [raycasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) technique to have a 3D rendering with a 2D plane, the game takes place in 5 waves. 4 of preparation and 1 boss phase. The goal is to navigate through a small level and collect money to improve.
